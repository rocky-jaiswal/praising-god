Job 21

Why troubles?

Troubles come because of the world we live in. Sometimes because of our actions, sometimes because of the action of others. 
Sometimes things happen over which we have no control.
The important thing is to live a holy life, praising God and trusting in His providence.

Isaiah 64

No ear heard, no eye seen, a God like you who works for those who wait for Him.
