# Bread & blessings

John 6:26

Jesus answered, “You’ve come looking for me not because you saw God in my actions but because I fed you, filled your stomachs—and for free."

They said - "Show us what you can do. Moses fed our ancestors with bread in the desert."

They wanted God to prove Himself. We should commit to God because of love, not because of blessings.
